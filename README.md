## 🌟 Why Use This?

Most calculators are boring. This one uses **Tkinter's `ttk` widgets**, giving it that "fresh out of the box" feel. It’s lightweight, fast, and doesn't track your data—it just calculates.

## ⚡ Features

* **Math Magic:** Add, subtract, multiply, and divide at lightning speed.
* **The "Oops" Guard:** If you try to do something crazy (like `5++5`), it politely tells you it's "Not Valid" instead of crashing.
* **Clean Aesthetic:** Uses a massive **24pt Arial font** so you can see your results from across the room.
* **Pro-Footer:** Features a signature "created by thanos katsifis" so everyone knows who the boss is.

## 🛠️ Secret Sauce (Tech Stack)

* **Python 3:** The brains.
* **Tkinter/ttk:** The beauty.
* **The `eval()` Engine:** For calculating complex strings instantly.
